In this set of experiments, we compare the `QP` version of WSSR and the `PSGD` implementation of WSSR only for the case of `affine` subspaces. The observations and comparisons are made in terms of the following:

(1) How different are the objective function values for all points between QP and PSGD?

(2) How different are the solution vectors obtained from QP and PSGD?

(3) How similar do the similarity matrices obtained from QP and PSGD look?
